# Redis for Video Streaming Applications

The pair of codes provided, one for sending video frames to Redis and the other for receiving and processing those frames, represents a simple distributed computing or communication model. Specifically, it can be considered a form of a client-server architecture where one script acts as the server (receiving and processing frames) and another as the client (sending frames to the server).

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Client Script (`send_frames_to_redis.py`)**
   - **Role:** Acts as a client that captures frames from a video source and sends them to a central server.
   - **Functionality:** Reads video frames, encodes them, and sends them, along with a frame counter, to a Redis server.
   - **Responsibility:** Initiates the communication and provides data to the central server.

2. **Server Script (`receive_and_process_frame.py`)**
   - **Role:** Acts as a server that receives frames from clients, decodes and processes them.
   - **Functionality:** Listens for incoming frames on Redis, decodes and processes them (in this case, saving the frames and printing counters).
   - **Responsibility:** Listens for and processes incoming data from clients.

This model can be part of a larger system, especially if you have multiple clients sending frames to a central server for processing. The communication is facilitated by Redis, serving as a message broker in this scenario.

In a broader context, if you extend the capabilities of this model, it could be considered a simplified form of a client-server architecture in a distributed system. This type of architecture is commonly used in various applications, such as image processing pipelines, video streaming systems, and distributed computing tasks.

## Publisher-Subscriber pattern

The communication pattern between the client and server scripts, using Redis as a message broker, aligns with the **Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub) pattern**.

In the Pub/Sub pattern:

- **Publisher (Client):** The script sending frames acts as the publisher. It publishes (sends) messages (frames) to a specific channel (in this case, using Redis as a channel).

- **Subscriber (Server):** The script receiving and processing frames acts as the subscriber. It subscribes to the channel and receives messages (frames) when they are published.

Redis provides a Pub/Sub mechanism that allows multiple clients to subscribe to channels and receive messages sent to those channels. In your case, the frames and counters are the messages being published and received via the Redis Pub/Sub mechanism.

The Pub/Sub pattern is commonly used for scenarios where multiple components of a system need to react to events or messages in an asynchronous and decoupled manner. It's particularly useful for distributing data or events to multiple consumers.

In summary, the communication pattern demonstrated by client-server scripts, with Redis facilitating message exchange, can be classified as the Publish-Subscribe pattern.


The Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub) pattern itself is often considered a messaging pattern rather than a full-fledged architectural pattern. However, when you use this pattern to structure the communication and interactions between different components or services in a system, it contributes to the overall system architecture. In this sense, it becomes part of the system's architectural design.

Architectural patterns, such as Microservices, Monolithic, Client-Server, and Event-Driven Architecture, describe the high-level organization of a system and how components interact. The Pub/Sub pattern can be employed within the context of various architectural patterns to handle communication between different parts of the system.


Here, the Pub/Sub pattern, facilitated by Redis, is a communication mechanism between the client (frame sender) and the server (frame receiver/processor).

The broader architecture could be described as a simplified form of a distributed system, where the components communicate asynchronously through a messaging mechanism.

While the Pub/Sub pattern is a crucial element in this design, the overall architecture would depend on the broader context of how these components fit into the larger system. It's common to see combinations of architectural patterns in real-world systems, and the Pub/Sub pattern often plays a role in enabling communication between distributed components.
